Editors,

Thank you for considering our submission, "Dynamic spatiotemporal modeling of a habitat defining plant species to support wildlife management at regional scales," for publication in Ecological Applications. In this paper, we expand on our previous work (Tredennick et al. 2016, Ecosphere) fitting and projecting dynamic population models for plant species over large spatial extents using remotely sensed data. We introduce a computationally efficient method for incorporating a spatial component in the statistical model when spatial coverage is complete, as is the case for remote sensing data. This method allows us to fit models to many large areas. We apply the model to project the impacts of climate change on 32 sagebrush management areas in Wyoming, which cover over 62,000 square kilometers. We find that most management areas are projected to increase in sagebrush cover in the future, which supports the existence of "sage-grouse core areas" in Wyoming. Our modeling approach can be applied in any case where remotely sensed estimates of a habitat defining species exist and offers a tool in addition to species distribution modeling for projecting the impacts of climate change on critical habitat. The combination of a broadly applicable modeling framework and an applied case study make this paper well suited for publication in Ecological Applications.


Sincerely,
Andrew Tredennick
